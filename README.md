# Library

> In this project, I build a web app called 'Library' where the users can save a list of books with the title, author, number of pages, and if they have read it.
The main object of this repo is to learn DOM([Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)) manipulation with JavaScript along with objects and constructors.
